Imagine we're building a new demo app for our community of developers. Please upload a project containing an app that displays 100 images of venues that are close to the current location of a user. Foursquare API can be a good source of such data but feel free to use any other API that is publicly available. Make sure there are tests in place and the UI stays responsive while loading remote resources.
